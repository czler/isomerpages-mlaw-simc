### **Introduction** 
The Singapore Convention on Mediation (the “Singapore Convention” or “Convention”) is a uniform and efficient framework for international settlement agreements resulting from mediation. It applies to international settlement agreements resulting from mediation, concluded by parties to resolve a commercial dispute.

The Singapore Convention will facilitate international trade and commerce by enabling disputing parties to easily enforce and invoke settlement agreements across borders. Businesses will benefit from mediation as an additional dispute resolution option to litigation and arbitration in settling cross-border disputes.

For more details, please view the [Convention Text]{/the-convention-text}

### **Key Milestones**

### **Signing of the Convention**
