### **Introduction** 
<!--
In December 2018, the United Nations General Assembly adopted, by consensus, the United Nations Convention on International Settlement Agreements Resulting from Mediation, recommended that the Convention be known as the “Singapore Convention on Mediation” (the “Singapore Convention” or “Convention”), and authorised the signing ceremony of the Convention to be held in Singapore on
7 August 2019.
-->
<!--
The Singapore Convention will facilitate international trade and commerce by enabling disputing parties to easily enforce and invoke settlement agreements across borders. Businesses will benefit from mediation as an additional dispute resolution option to litigation and arbitration in settling cross-border disputes.
-->
The Singapore Convention on Mediation (“the Convention”) Signing Ceremony and Conference was held in Singapore on 7 August 2019. Barely six months later, the Singapore Parliament passed the Singapore Convention on Mediation Act 2020 (“the Act”) in February 2020. The introduction of the Act, which gives effect to the Convention, is a significant step in Singapore’s overall efforts to strengthen its international commercial dispute resolution framework.

Forty-six countries, including the world’s two largest economies, the United States and China, and three of the four largest economies in Asia, China, India and South Korea, signed the Convention on the day it opened for signature, while another 24 countries attended the signing ceremony to show their support for the Convention. Subsequently, six more countries signed the Convention, bringing the total number of signatory countries to 52.

Singapore and Fiji were the first two countries to deposit their respective instruments of ratification of the Convention at the United Nations (UN) Headquarters in New York. The Convention will enter into force six months after the third State deposits its instrument of ratification, acceptance and approval or accession.
